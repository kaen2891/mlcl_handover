LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0032.flac,4.235,IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0000.flac,5.1549375,HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0014.flac,3.375,WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0031.flac,7.76,FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0016.flac,6.275,BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0008.flac,6.245,THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0017.flac,2.31,AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0013.flac,3.43,AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0003.flac,3.625,WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0023.flac,4.18,WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0020.flac,7.85,THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0030.flac,6.34,AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0010.flac,3.18,BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0029.flac,10.56,AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0027.flac,2.695,THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0022.flac,4.15,AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0005.flac,3.145,AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/10919/4350-10919-0006.flac,3.55,THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0007.flac,4.755,THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0002.flac,9.31,IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0046.flac,6.165,EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0028.flac,10.485,BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0057.flac,14.315,EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0011.flac,3.745,ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0016.flac,7.47,AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0052.flac,12.295,THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0039.flac,6.875,THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0015.flac,6.44,IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0037.flac,11.93,BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0055.flac,7.675,AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0018.flac,7.095,INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0035.flac,3.875,THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0056.flac,7.975,THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0017.flac,2.825,BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0020.flac,7.42,AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0043.flac,10.28,THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0049.flac,6.355,EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0014.flac,8.745,BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0004.flac,4.415,THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0044.flac,2.435,AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0041.flac,8.465,BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0040.flac,6.28,THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0038.flac,7.8,BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0026.flac,10.3,THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0013.flac,15.405,EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0033.flac,13.17,THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0001.flac,2.06,THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0050.flac,4.855,WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0010.flac,2.285,INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0029.flac,4.42,AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0023.flac,9.5,FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0025.flac,17.13,THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0027.flac,3.045,AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0008.flac,3.535,THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0003.flac,9.245,THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0036.flac,13.525,IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0030.flac,4.245,THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0034.flac,7.185,AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
