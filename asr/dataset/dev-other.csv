LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0003.flac,11.995,THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0000.flac,4.3,BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0002.flac,5.49,THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0009.flac,6.365,SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0005.flac,4.89,NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0004.flac,4.055,THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0013.flac,3.935,NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0017.flac,6.01,OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0020.flac,5.71,SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0000.flac,4.18,FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0008.flac,6.995,THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0015.flac,2.905,THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0001.flac,4.48,THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0003.flac,6.04,SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0016.flac,5.95,INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0010.flac,7.31,OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0002.flac,6.475,THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0006.flac,4.23,THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0011.flac,4.065,MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0018.flac,4.26,THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0007.flac,10.985,THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0019.flac,10.02,IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0014.flac,17.785,I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0012.flac,7.885,THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0027.flac,7.88,SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0007.flac,7.675,LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE IS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0003.flac,6.915,ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0022.flac,2.205,THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0013.flac,3.35,TO MORROW LADY I THINK HE WILL BE HERE WITH THE MAIDEN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0012.flac,4.98,THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0002.flac,8.45,IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0005.flac,5.22,THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0013.flac,13.46,THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0022.flac,2.62,IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0004.flac,4.59,NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0003.flac,9.95,AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0015.flac,4.34,THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0017.flac,3.21,I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0006.flac,9.07,THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0011.flac,3.46,HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0021.flac,4.23,AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0009.flac,2.525,FOUR FIVE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0010.flac,5.29,BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0001.flac,15.77,STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0016.flac,3.505,SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0007.flac,5.38,AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0000.flac,29.5,IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0023.flac,3.17,THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0014.flac,3.0,THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0008.flac,2.315,TWO THREE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0029.flac,5.8,THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0007.flac,4.66,BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0010.flac,1.62,YOU HAVE HEARD SO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0011.flac,3.28,I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0008.flac,4.195,MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0017.flac,6.4,IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0027.flac,2.97,YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0015.flac,7.98,JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0002.flac,2.45,WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0022.flac,6.7,THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0021.flac,5.08,HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0019.flac,3.2,THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0020.flac,6.06,HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0003.flac,4.67,I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0009.flac,3.06,BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0013.flac,2.34,WAS THAT THIS EVENING
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0018.flac,3.18,THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0000.flac,4.725,HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0005.flac,1.38,I SHOULD THINK SO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0028.flac,4.48,HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0026.flac,11.14,BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0023.flac,8.225,HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0001.flac,8.43,BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0006.flac,3.685,HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0024.flac,3.77,I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0014.flac,2.82,AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0030.flac,2.445,AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0016.flac,4.56,NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0021.flac,2.09,I CAN DO THAT TOO
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0005.flac,2.565,IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0020.flac,3.81,I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0007.flac,4.64,IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0017.flac,3.31,IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0001.flac,3.45,BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0008.flac,18.37,OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0004.flac,2.32,BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0003.flac,5.89,I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0022.flac,2.56,AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0002.flac,4.85,THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0011.flac,5.16,AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0013.flac,5.83,IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0016.flac,5.665,WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0009.flac,3.18,THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0010.flac,6.87,BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0012.flac,4.055,WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0000.flac,2.435,THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0015.flac,7.75,I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED

LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0005.flac,8.61,IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0024.flac,9.53,AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
LibriSpeech/LibriSpeech/dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0017.flac,2.7,I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
